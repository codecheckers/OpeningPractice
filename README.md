# Abstract

This paper reflects on trends towards a more open and reprocible approach to spatial data science over recent years. In particular it considers trends towards Big Data and data analytics,  and the effect this has on *spatial* data and modelling. It identifies a turn in academia towards coding as a core analytic tool,  and away from proprietory software tools offering 'black boxes' where internal working of the analysis are not revealed. It is argued that this closed form software is problematic,  and considers a number of ways in which issues identified in spatial data analysis could be overlooked when working with closed tools, leading to problems of interpretation and possibly inappropriate actions and policies based on these. In addition it reviews calls for a critical approach to data science,  and considers the role that reproducible and open spatial science may play in such an approach, taking into account the issues raised.

This repo contains the data and code for a small illustration of the MUAP that was used in the paper.
